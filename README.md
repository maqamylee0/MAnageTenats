# Kitubs 
- An app to help landlords keep track of tenants' monthly rent and records.

## Functionalities.
1. Login/SignUp
2. Add tenants and their details such as monthly payments.
3. Make payments.
4. Identify how much has been paid in advance and how much is left by each and all tenants
5. Renew payments for each month.

## Brief

This project is a challenge to use AWS Amplify while helping a friend manage their tenants.

I learned how AWS Amplify works and compared it to Firebase services.

I was able to implement simple mathematics logic to ensure whenever payments are made, the balances are updated.

I also faced a lot of challenges, especially in deciding how to renew monthly balances.
